# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## ðŸ”¹ Project Description
Customer churn is when clients stop doing business with a company. Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, so predicting churn helps businesses take proactive measures.  

This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict whether a customer will churn based on demographic, service usage, and account details. By identifying churn-prone customers, businesses can improve retention strategies.
