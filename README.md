# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## ðŸ”¹ Project Description
Customer churn is when clients stop doing business with a company. Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, so predicting churn helps businesses take proactive measures.  

This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict whether a customer will churn based on demographic, service usage, and account details. By identifying churn-prone customers, businesses can improve retention strategies.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Preprocessed and cleaned raw customer data.  
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations.  
- Built and compared ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost.  
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**.  
- Identified important features influencing churn.

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset
- Includes features like:  
  - Customer demographics (gender, senior citizen, dependents, etc.)  
  - Account details (contract type, payment method, tenure, charges)  
  - Target variable: **Churn (Yes/No)**

## ðŸ”¹ Results
- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn
- High monthly charges increase churn probability
- Customers with short tenure show higher churn rates
- Random Forest and XGBoost performed the best with strong ROC-AUC
